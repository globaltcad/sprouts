  "narrative":"The Sprouts Property Lens is based on the Lens design pattern.\n    The Lens design pattern is a functional programming \n    technique used to simplify the process of accessing and updating parts of \n    a nested (immutable) data structures into a new instance of the data structure.\n\n    A Lens is essentially a pair of functions: \n    one to get a value from a specific part of a data structure (like a record), \n    and another to set or update that value while producing a new \n    instance of the data structure. This pattern is particularly useful with Java records, \n    which are immutable by design, as it allows for clean and concise manipulation \n    of deeply nested fields without breaking immutability.\n\n    Now what does this have to do with Sprouts properties?\n    After all, the MVVM properties of this library are mutable \n    wrapper types with regular getter and setter methods.\n    Although properties are mutable, their items are expected to\n    be immutable data carriers, such as ints, doubles, strings or records.\n    In case of records (or other custom value oriented data types),\n    there is really no limit to how deeply nested the data structure can be.\n    You may even want to model your entire application state as a single record\n    composed of other records, lists, maps and primitives.\n    This is where the Property Lens comes in:\n\n    You can create a lens property from any regular property\n    holding an immutable data structure, and then use the lens property\n    like a regular property.\n\n    Under the hood the lens property will use the lens pattern to access\n    and update the nested data structure of the original property.\n\n    In this specification we will demonstrate how to create and use\n    lens properties and also explore edge cases and limitations.\n\n    In this Specification we are using the following \n    data structure classes:\n    ````java\n        import java.time.LocalDate;\n        import java.util.List;\n\n        // Enums\n        enum Genre {\n            FICTION, NON_FICTION,
