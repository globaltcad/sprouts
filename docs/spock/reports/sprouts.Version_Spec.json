  "narrative":"When doing functional or data oriented programming then you are\n    working with value objects. These are objects that are immutable\n    and define their identity in terms of their values.\n    Which means that two objects are considered equal if they have\n    the same values, even if they are different instances.\n\n    To model identity in value objects Sprouts provides the `Version` class.\n    It is a value object representing a unique ID. This ID consisting\n    of two numbers, a lineage and succession number allowing you to identify something\n    and also determine the order in which something was created\n    and updated.\n    This is intended to be used to emulate identity in\n    your value objects, which is useful for tracking changes\n    and synchronizing state across different parts of your application.\n    You may also use version changes to do reactive programming\n    for your value based view models, similar as you would do with\n    `Event`s in traditional place oriented view models.",
