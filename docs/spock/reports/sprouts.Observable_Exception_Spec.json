  "narrative":"The Sprouts observable types (Viewable, Var, Observable, Event) are designed to handle\n    exceptions gracefully in user-supplied lambdas while maintaining proper control flow.\n\n    Key behaviors:\n    1. Regular exceptions in observers/actions are caught and logged without breaking the control flow\n    2. InterruptedException is re-thrown to preserve Java's concurrency model\n    3. Serious Error types (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError) are not caught\n    4. Thread interrupt status is properly managed\n\n    These tests verify that all observable types maintain consistent exception handling\n    behavior across different scenarios.",
