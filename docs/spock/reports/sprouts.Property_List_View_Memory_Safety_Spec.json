  "narrative":"Both the read only `Vals` and the mutable `Vars` are designed to be\n    used as part of a view model in a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture\n    or Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture.\n    As a consequence, they need to be observable in some way.\n    This is done by registering change listeners on \n    their so called \"views\", which are weakly referenced\n    live views of the original property lists which get updated\n    automatically when the original property changes.\n    You can then subscribe to these views to get notified\n    of changes to the original property.\n\n    This is especially useful when you want to observe a property list\n    of one type as a property list of another type, or when you want to\n    observe a property lists with some transformation applied to them.\n\n    This specification shows how to create views from both nullable and non-nullable property lists,\n    and it demonstrates how they may be garbage collected when they are no longer referenced.",
