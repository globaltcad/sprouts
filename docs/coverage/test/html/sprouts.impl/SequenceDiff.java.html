/**
 *  A {@link SequenceDiff} object holds meta information about a {@link Tuple} instance
 *  that describes how the {@link Tuple} was transformed from its previous state.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  So for example, if the {@link Tuple#removeFirst(int)}
 *  method was called with a count of 3, then the resulting {@link Tuple}
 *  will internally maintain a {@link SequenceDiff} instance with
 *  a {@link #change()} == {@link SequenceChange#REMOVE},
 *  {@link #index()} == 0 and {@link #size()} == 3.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The purpose of this class is to provides meta information specifically
 *  for efficient binding and change propagation to other
 *  data structures, such as UI components, databases, or network services.&lt;br&gt;
 *  More specifically, it allows a change listener to synchronize to the
 *  {@link Tuple} state changes in an optimized way, by only updating its
 *  own target data structure according to the information provided by the
 *  {@link SequenceDiff} instance.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  In practice, you would only do this optimized sync to a tuple after first checking if
 *  {@link #isDirectSuccessorOf(SequenceDiff)} is true, and then update the target data structure
 *  with the information provided by the {@link SequenceDiff} instance.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Although this class is specifically designed for the {@link Tuple} type,
 *  you may also use this class with other immutable value based sequenced collections
 *  to do optimized synchronization to state changes.
