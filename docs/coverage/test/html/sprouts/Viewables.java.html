/**
 *  A read-only live view on a delegated list of items derived from a {@link Vars} or {@link Vals},
 *  which can be observed for changes using {@link Action}s registered through the {@link #onChange(Action)} method.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The API of this is very similar to the {@link Vals} API in the sense that it is a readonly list of properties.
 *  However, this interface extends the {@link Observable} interface
 *  to allow registering {@link Action}s which will be called when the list of properties
 *  change their state.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  If you no longer need to observe changes on this list of properties, then you can remove the registered {@link Action}
 *  callback using the {@link #unsubscribe(Subscriber)} method ({@link Action} is also a {@link Subscriber}).
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Instances of this are intended to be created from {@link Vals}/{@link Vars} property lists.
 *  {@link sprouts.Viewables} created from such a property list is weakly referenced by it.
 *  You can register change listeners on it, and when you no longer want changes
 *  to be propagated to the {@link sprouts.Viewables},
 *  then you can drop its reference, and it will be garbage collected
 *  alongside all of its change listeners automatically.
 *
 * @see Vals A super type of this class with a read-only API.
 * @see Var A mutable property API and subtype of {@code Vals}.
 * @see Viewable A single property with a similar API to this one.
 * @see Observable The interface which this extends to allow registering {@code Action}s.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the items held by this {@link Vals}.

     *  Regular properties, created from the various factory methods in {@link Vals} and {@link Vars},

     *  Although {@link Vals} and {@link Vars} do not extend {@link Viewables} directly,
     *  you may cast them to a {@link Viewables} to get access to the {@link Viewables} API.&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  This method is a convenience method that allows you to cast
     *  the given {@link Vals} instance to a {@link Viewables}.&lt;br&gt;
     *  The main intention of this method is to allow you to register change listeners
     *  on the given {@link Vals} instance, which will be called whenever the items
     *  viewed by this {@link Viewables} changes after operations to
     *  the source property list.
     *  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
     *      WARNING:
     *      The change listeners registered on the cast property list will not
     *      be garbage collected automatically. You must remove them manually
     *      when no longer needed. &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  If you want to protect yourself from memory leaks caused by change listeners,
     *  create a {@link Viewables} instance through the {@link Vals#view()} method,
     *  and register change listeners on that instance instead.&lt;br&gt;
     *  The {@link Viewables} instance created through the {@link Vals#view()} method
     *  will be garbage collected automatically when no longer needed, and all
     *  change listeners registered on it will be removed automatically.
     *
     * @param vals The {@link Vals} instance to cast to a {@link Viewables}.
     * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by the {@link Vals} instance.
