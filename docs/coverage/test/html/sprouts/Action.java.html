     *  A factory method for creating a new {@link Action} instance
     *  with a weakly referenced owner.
     *  When the owner is garbage collected then the action will no longer be executed,
     *  removed and eventually be garbage automatically as well.&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;b&gt;
     *      WARNING: &lt;br&gt;
     *      If you reference the owner in the action lambda, may it be directly or indirectly,
     *      then you will end up with a memory leak, as the owner will never be garbage collected!
     *  &lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;br&gt;
     *  This is because the action lambda is strongly held until the owner is collected, and
     *  the owner may only be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it.
     *  This includes the action lambda itself, which may not hold a strong reference to the owner!
     *  To access the owner of the action in the actions {@link BiConsumer},
     *  it is passed to it as its first argument.
     *  &lt;b&gt;Use that parameter instead of the owner reference.&lt;/b&gt;
     *
     * @param owner The owner of the action, which is weakly referenced
     *              and determines the lifetime of the action.
     * @param action A {@link BiConsumer} that takes in the owner and the delegate
     *               and is executed when the action is triggered.
     * @return A new {@link Action} instance with a weakly referenced owner.
     * @param &lt;D&gt; The type of the delegate that will be passed to this event handler.
     * @param &lt;O&gt; The type of the owner.
