/**
 *  This is a value object representing a unique ID consisting
 *  of two numbers, a lineage and succession, allowing you to identify something
 *  and also determine the order in which something was created
 *  and updated. &lt;br&gt;
 *  This is intended to be used to emulate identity in
 *  your value objects, which is useful for tracking changes
 *  and synchronizing state across different parts of your application.&lt;br&gt;
 *  You may also use version changes to do reactive programming
 *  for your value based view models, similar as you would do with
 *  {@link Event}s in traditional place oriented view models.&lt;br&gt;
 *  Consider the following example:&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;View Model:&lt;/b&gt;
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *    public record SearchViewModel(
 *        String searchKey,
 *        Tuple&lt;String&gt; searchResult,
 *        String selection,
 *        Version closeSearch
 *    ) {
 *        public SearchViewModel doSearch(String searchKey) {
 *          var newSearchResults = Database.search(searchKey);
 *          return new SearchViewModel(searchKey, newSearchResults, selection, closeSearch);
 *        }
 *        public SearchViewModel withSelection(String selection) {
 *          var currentCloseSearch = closeSearch;
 *          if ( !selection.isBlank() &amp;&amp; this.searchResult.contains(selection) ) {
 *              currentCloseSearch = currentCloseSearch.next();
 *          }
 *          return new SearchViewModel(searchKey, searchResult, selection, currentCloseSearch);
 *        }
 *    }
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;View:&lt;/b&gt;
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *    public final class SearchView {
 *        Var&lt;String&gt; searchKey;
 *        Var&lt;String&gt; selection;
 *        Viewable&lt;Tuple&lt;String&gt;&gt; searchResult;
 *        Observable closeSearch;
 *
 *        public static void main(String[] args) {
 *            var search = new SearchViewModel(&quot;&quot;, Tuple.of(String.class), &quot;&quot;, Version.create());
 *            var applicationState = Var.of(search);
 *            var view = new SearchView(applicationState);
 *            // show view...
 *        }
 *
 *        public SearchView(Var&lt;SearchViewModel&gt; vm) {
 *            this.searchKey    = vm.zoomTo(SearchViewModel::searchKey, SearchViewModel::doSearch);
 *            this.selection    = vm.zoomTo(SearchViewModel::selection, SearchViewModel::withSelection);
 *            this.searchResult = vm.view(SearchViewModel::searchResult);
 *            this.closeSearch  = vm.view(SearchViewModel::closeSearch);
 *
 *            // build GUI and bind to properties...
 *
 *            closeSearch.subscribe( () -&gt; {
 *                // close search view...
 *            })
 *        }
 *    }
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  In this example, the {@link Version} object is used to send a signal
 *  to the view when the selection is set to a valid value.
 *  We are using the state changes of the {@link Version} object
 *  to trigger an action in the view, just like you would with an {@link Event}.
 *  The difference here is that the {@link Version} object is a value object
 *  and so you are not forced to write place oriented code, but can instead
 *  write value/data oriented code, which is substantially easier to test and
 *  reason about.
