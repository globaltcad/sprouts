/**
 * 	A read only live view on a delegated item which can be observed for changes
 * 	using {@link Action}s registered through the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method,
 * 	where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish between changes from
 * 	different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).
 * 	The API of this is very similar to the {@link Optional} API in the
 * 	sense that it is a null safe wrapper around a single item, which may also be missing (null).
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	The {@link Channel} supplied to the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method to register an {@link Action}
 * 	callback is expected to be a simple constant, usually one of the {@link From} constants
 * 	like for example {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW}.
 * 	You may fire a change event for a particular channel using the {@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or
 * 	in case the property is also a mutable {@link Var}, then through the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}.&lt;br&gt;
 * 	Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	If you no longer need to observe changes on this property, then you can remove the registered {@link Action}
 * 	callback using the {@link #unsubscribe(Subscriber)} method ({@link Action} is also a {@link Subscriber}).
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	Instances of this are intended to be created from {@link Val}
 * 	and {@link Var} properties. When they are created from these
 * 	regular properties, then they are weakly referenced there.
 * 	You can register change listeners on instances of this, and
 * 	when you no longer want changes to be propagated to an instance
 * 	of this, you can drop its reference, and it will be garbage collected
 * 	alongside all of its change listeners.
 *
 * @see Val A super type of this class with a read-only API.
 * @see Var A mutable property API and subtype of {@link Val}.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by this {@link Val}.

     *  This method is a convenience method which allows you to cast
     *  the given {@link Val} instance to a {@link Viewable}.&lt;br&gt;
     *  The main intention of this method is to allow you to register change listeners
     *  on the given {@link Val} instance, which will be called whenever the item
     *  viewed by this {@link Viewable} changes through the {@code Var::set(Channel, T)} method.&lt;br&gt;

     *      be garbage collected automatically. You must remove them manually
     *      when no longer needed. &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  If you want to protect yourself from memory leaks caused by change listeners,
     *  create a {@link Viewable} instance through the {@link Val#view()} method,
     *  and register change listeners on that instance instead.&lt;br&gt;
     *  The {@link Viewable} instance created through the {@link Val#view()} method
     *  will be garbage collected automatically when no longer needed, and all
     *  change listeners registered on it will be removed automatically.
     *
     * @param val The {@link Val} instance to cast to a {@link Viewable}.
     * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by the {@link Val} instance.
