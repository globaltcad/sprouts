/**
 *  A read-only live view on a delegated item derived from a {@link Var} or {@link Val}, which
 *  can be observed for changes using {@link Action}s registered through the
 *  {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method, where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish
 *  between changes from different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).
 *  The API of this is designed to be a null safe wrapper around a single item, which may also be missing (null).
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The {@link Channel} supplied to the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method to register an {@link Action}
 *  callback is expected to be a simple constant, usually one of the {@link From} constants
 *  like for example {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW}.
 *  You may fire a change event for a particular channel using the {@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or
 *  in case the property is also a mutable {@link Var}, then through the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}.&lt;br&gt;
 *  Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  If you no longer need to observe changes on this property, then you can remove the registered {@link Action}
 *  callback using the {@link #unsubscribe(Subscriber)} method ({@link Action} is also a {@link Subscriber}).
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Instances of this are intended to be created from {@link Val}
 *  and {@link Var} properties, using the following methods, among others:
 *  &lt;ul&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link Var#view()}&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link Val#view()}&lt;/li&gt;
 *  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 *  When they are created from these
 *  regular properties, then they are weakly referenced there.
 *  You can register change listeners on instances of this, and
 *  when you no longer want changes to be propagated to an instance
 *  of this, you can drop its reference, and it will be garbage collected
 *  alongside all of its change listeners.
 *
 * @see Val A super type of this class with a read-only API.
 * @see Var A mutable property API and subtype of {@code Val}.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by this {@link Val}.

    /**
     *  Casts the given {@link Val} instance to a {@link Viewable} instance usually with the
     *  purpose of registering change listeners on it.&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;b&gt;WARNING: Only call this method in a class constructor with
     *  a property which is also a member variable of that class.
     *  Otherwise, you are risking memory leaks!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  Regular properties, created from the various factory methods in {@link Val} and {@link Var},
     *  (may) also implement the {@link Viewable} interface internally. &lt;br&gt;
     *  Although {@link Val} and {@link Var} do not extend {@link Viewable} directly,
     *  you may cast them to a {@link Viewable} to get access to the {@link Viewable} API,
     *  and then register change listeners onto it.&lt;br&gt;
     *  These will be called whenever the item in the {@link Val} or {@link Var} changes,
     *  through the {@code Var::set(Channel, T)} method.&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  Casting, however, is a bit of a hack, and it is not recommended to use this method
     *  anywhere else than in a class constructor, because otherwise it is hard to reason about
     *  how many change listeners are registered on a property and what they capture.
     *  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
     *      This is problematic because:&lt;br&gt;
     *      The change listeners registered on the cast property will not
     *      be garbage collected automatically. You must remove them manually
     *      when no longer needed. &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;p&gt;
     *  If you want to protect yourself from memory leaks caused by change listeners,
     *  create a {@link Viewable} instance through the {@link Val#view()} method,
     *  and register change listeners on that instance instead.&lt;br&gt;
     *  The {@link Viewable} instance created through the {@link Val#view()} method
     *  will be garbage collected automatically when no longer needed, and all
     *  change listeners registered on it will be removed automatically.
     *

     * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by the {@link Val} instance.
