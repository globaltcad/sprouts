/**
 *  An event is something that can be triggered and reacted to, through {@link Observable}s
 *  created by the {@link #observable()} method.
 *  It is a form of the observer pattern where an {@link Event} is a source of
 *  events (or notifications) and the {@link Observable}s are the objects where
 *  you register to receive these notifications through your
 *  implementations of the functional {@link Observer} interface.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The registered {@link Observer}s are invoked when the {@link #fire()} method is called
 *  on the {@link Event}.
 *  Contrary to events received by property observers (see {@link sprouts.Action}), observing an {@link Event}
 *  does not involve any state.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Note that you need to maintain a reference to an {@link Observable} onto which
 *  you have registered one or more {@link Observer}s in order to keep receiving notifications.
 *  This is because the {@link Observable} is weakly referenced and will be garbage collected
 *  along with all its observers if there are no strong references to it.
 *  This is a feature, not a bug, as it allows you to avoid memory leaks in your code
 *  by automatically unsubscribing from events when you no longer need them.
