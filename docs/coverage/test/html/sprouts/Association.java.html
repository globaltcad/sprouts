/**
 *  Defines an association between keys and values
 *  as an immutable value object where the values
 *  are accessed by the keys in a map-like fashion.
 *  An association cannot contain duplicate keys,
 *  and each key can map to at most one value.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;br&gt;
 *  You may think of this as a {@link java.util.Map}
 *  but without the ability to modify the association
 *  after it has been created. Instead, you may create
 *  a new association with the desired changes using
 *  methods like {@link #put(Object, Object)} or
 *  {@link #remove(Object)}.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 *      Note: Mutable objects should not be stored in an
 *      association, especially keys, whose hash code
 *      and equality has to stay constant for the lifetime
 *      of the association because the association assumes
 *      that their behavior does not change.
 *      The behavior of this class is uncertain if a key
 *      is changed in a manner that affects equals
 *      or hashCode after it has been added to the association.
 *  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *
