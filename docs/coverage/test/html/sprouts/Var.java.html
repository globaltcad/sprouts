/**
 *  A mutable wrapper for an item which can also be mapped to a weakly referenced{@link Viewable} to
 *  be observed for changes using {@link Action}s registered through the {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)} method,
 *  where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish between changes from
 *  different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).&lt;br&gt;
 *  Use {@link #view()} to access a simple no-op live view of the item of this property
 *  and register change listeners on it to react to state changes.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The {@link Channel} constant passed to {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)} ensures that the
 *  corresponding {@link Action} callback is only invoked when the
 *  {@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}
 *  method is invoked with the same {@link Channel}.
 *  Usually you will use the {@link From} constants to distinguish between
 *  important application layers using the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW} channels.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel,
 *  which is intended to be used for state changes as part of your core business logic.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  So for example if you have a {@link Var} which represents the username
 *  of a form, then inside your UI you can register a callback using {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)}
 *  using the channel {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} which
 *  will update the UI accordingly when {@link #set(Object)} is called inside you view model. &lt;br&gt;
 *  On the other hand, when the UI changes the property through the {@code #set(From.View, object)}
 *  method, all {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)} with the channel {@link From#VIEW} listeners
 *  will be notified. &lt;br&gt;
 *  Consider the following example property in your view model:
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *      // A username property with a validation action:
 *      private final Var&lt;String&gt; username = Var.of(&quot;&quot;);
 *      private final Viewable&lt;String&gt; usernameView = this.username.view().onChange(From.VIEW v -&gt; validateUser(v) );
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  And the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/globaltcad/swing-tree&quot;&gt;SwingTree&lt;/a&gt;
 *  example UI:
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *      UI.textField(&quot;&quot;)
 *      .peek( tf -&gt; vm.getUsernameView().onChange(From.VIEW_MODEL t -&gt; tf.setText(t.get()) ) )
 *      .onKeyRelease( e -&gt; vm.getUsername().set(From.VIEW, ta.getText() ) );
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  Here your view will automatically update the item of the text property
 *  and inside your view model you can freely update the username property,
 *  and it will then also automatically update the text field in the UI:
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *      // Initially empty username:
 *      username.set( &quot;&quot; ) // triggers 'fireChange(From.VIEW_MODEL)'
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  If you no longer need to observe a property, you can use the {@link Viewable#unsubscribe(Subscriber)}
 *  method to remove all {@link Action}s (which are also {@link Subscriber}s) registered
 *  through {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)}.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Note that the name of this class is short for &quot;variable&quot;. This name was deliberately chosen because
 *  it is short, concise and yet clearly conveys the same meaning as other names used to model this
 *  kind of pattern, like &quot;property&quot;, &quot;observable object&quot;, &quot;observable value&quot;, &quot;observable property&quot;, etc.
 *  Using the names {@link Var} and {@link Val} also allows for the distinction between
 *  mutable and immutable properties without having to resort to prefixes like &quot;mutable&quot; or &quot;immutable&quot;
 *  as part of a type that is supposed to be used everywhere in your code.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;Please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globaltcad.github.io/sprouts/&quot;&gt;living sprouts documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 *  where you can browse a large collection of examples demonstrating how to use the API of this class.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * @see Val A super type of this class with a read-only API.
 * @see Viewable A weakly referenced, read only live view of mutable properties
 *               to be used for registering change listeners.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the wrapped item.

     *        distinct {@code T} values, preventing ambiguous updates.
     *    &lt;/li&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surjectivity is required for coverage:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code getter} should be

    /**
     * Creates a projected lens property (Var) that bi-directionally maps between the item type {@code T}
     * of this property and a nullable target item type {@code B} using conversion functions.
     * This method allows the projected property to hold null values, which is useful when
     * the conversion between types is partial or may fail.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;Mathematical Foundation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     * The functions define a partial bijection between subsets of {@code T} and {@code B}.&lt;br&gt;
     * For the subset where conversion is defined:
     *  &lt;ul&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;{@code setter.apply(getter.apply(t)).equals(t)} should hold&lt;/li&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;{@code getter.apply(setter.apply(b)).equals(b)} should hold&lt;/li&gt;
     *  &lt;/ul&gt;
     * Outside this subset, null serves as an explicit representation of &quot;no valid conversion&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;Important Considerations:&lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;ul&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Partial functions require careful handling:&lt;/b&gt; When {@code getter} returns null
     *        (indicating no valid conversion), {@code setter} should handle null appropriately,
     *        typically by returning a sensible default or sentinel value.
     *    &lt;/li&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-isomorphic behavior is expected:&lt;/b&gt; Unlike {@code projectTo}, this method
     *        explicitly accommodates non-isomorphic conversions by allowing null as a valid state.
     *    &lt;/li&gt;
     *    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Null propagation:&lt;/b&gt; If this property's item is null, the projected property
     *         will also be null, unless {@code getter} handles null explicitly.
     *    &lt;/li&gt;
     *  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;Example - String to Double Parsing with Error Handling:&lt;/b&gt;
     * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *    Var&lt;String&gt; text = Var.of(&quot;1ooo&quot;); // Note: contains 'o' instead of '0'
     *    Var&lt;Double&gt; num = text.projectToNullable(
     *        Double.class,
     *        s -&gt; {
     *            try {
     *                return Double.parseDouble(s);
     *            } catch (Exception e) {
     *                return null; // Conversion failed
     *            }
     *        },
     *        d -&gt; d == null ? &quot;&quot; : d.toString()
     *    );
     *
     *    // Initial: text.get() = &quot;1ooo&quot;, num.get() = null (parsing failed)
     *
     *    text.set(&quot;3.14&quot;);
     *    // Now: text.get() = &quot;3.14&quot;, num.get() = 3.14
     *
     *    num.set(null);
     *    // Now: text.get() = &quot;&quot;, num.get() = null
     * }&lt;/pre&gt;
     * This example demonstrates graceful handling of conversion failures through null.
     * The projection maintains synchronization for valid conversions while using null
     * to represent unconvertible states.
     *
     * @param &lt;B&gt;    The nullable target type of the projected property.
     * @param type   The class object representing type {@code B}, required for
     *               runtime type information and nullability support.
     * @param getter {@link Function} that converts from {@code T} to {@code B}, returning
     *               null when conversion is not possible or meaningful.
     * @param setter {@link Function} that converts from {@code B} back to {@code T},
     *               handling null input appropriately.
     * @return A new Var that maintains a bidirectional projection allowing
     *         null values in both directions.
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code type} or either function is null.
