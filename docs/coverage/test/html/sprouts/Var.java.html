/**
 * 	A mutable wrapper for an item which can be observed for changes
 * 	using {@link Action}s registered through the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method,
 * 	where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish between changes from
 * 	different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	The {@link Channel} constant passed to {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} ensures that the
 * 	corresponding {@link Action} callback is only invoked when the
 * 	{@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}
 *  method is invoked with the same {@link Channel}.
 *  Usually you will use the {@link From} constants to distinguish between
 *  important application layers using the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW} channels.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * 	Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel,
 * 	which is intended to be used for state changes as part of your core business logic.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 * 	So for example if you have a {@link Var} which represents the username
 * 	of a form, then inside your UI you can register a callback using {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)}
 * 	using the channel {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} which
 * 	will update the UI accordingly when {@link #set(Object)} is called inside you view model. &lt;br&gt;
 * 	On the other hand, when the UI changes the property through the {@code #set(From.View, object)}
 * 	method, all {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} with the channel {@link From#VIEW} listeners
 * 	will be notified. &lt;br&gt;
 * 	Consider the following example property in your view model:
 * 	&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * 	    // A username property with a validation action:
 * 		private final Var&lt;String&gt; username = Var.of(&quot;&quot;).onChange(From.VIEW v -&gt; validateUser(v) );
 * 	}&lt;/pre&gt;
 * 	And the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/globaltcad/swing-tree&quot;&gt;SwingTree&lt;/a&gt;
 * 	example UI:
 * 	&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * 	    UI.textField(&quot;&quot;)
 * 	    .peek( tf -&gt; vm.getUsername().onChange(From.VIEW_MODEL t -&gt; tf.setText(t.get()) ) )
 * 	    .onKeyRelease( e -&gt; vm.getUsername().set(From.VIEW, ta.getText() ) );
 * 	}&lt;/pre&gt;
 * 	Here your view will automatically update the item of the text property
 * 	and inside your view model you can freely update the username property
 * 	and it will automatically update the text field in the UI:
 * 	&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * 	    // Initially empty username:
 * 		username.set( &quot;&quot; ) // triggers 'fireChange(From.VIEW_MODEL)'
 * 	}&lt;/pre&gt;
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	If you no longer need to observe a property, you can use the {@link #unsubscribe(Subscriber)}
 * 	method to remove all {@link Action}s (which are also {@link Subscriber}s) registered
 * 	through {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)}.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	Note that the name of this class is short for &quot;variable&quot;. This name was deliberately chosen because
 * 	it is short, concise and yet clearly conveys the same meaning as other names used to model this
 * 	kind of pattern, like &quot;property&quot;, &quot;observable object&quot;, &quot;observable value&quot;, &quot;observable property&quot;, etc.
 *  Using the names {@link Var} and {@link Val} also allows for the distinction between
 *  mutable and immutable properties without having to resort to prefixes like &quot;mutable&quot; or &quot;immutable&quot;
 *  as part of a type that is supposed to be used everywhere in your code.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	&lt;b&gt;Please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globaltcad.github.io/sprouts/&quot;&gt;living sprouts documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 * 	where you can browse a large collection of examples demonstrating how to use the API of this class.&lt;/b&gt;

	 * Creates a nullable lens property (Var) that focuses on a specific nullable field of the current data structure.
	 * This method is used to zoom into an immutable nested data structure, allowing read and write operations on
	 * a specific nullable field via getter and wither functions.
	 *
	 * &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a record {@code User} with an optional email field. Using {@code zoomToNullable},
	 * you can create a lens specifically for the email field, which is optional and can be null.
	 *

	 * // Creating a lens for the nullable email field
	 * var emailLens = userProperty.zoomToNullable(String.class, User::email, User::withEmail);
