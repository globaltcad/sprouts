/**
 * 	A read only view on a wrapped item which can be observed for changes
 * 	using {@link Action}s registered through the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method,
 * 	where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish between changes from
 * 	different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).
 * 	The API of this is very similar to the {@link Optional} API in the
 * 	sense that it is a null safe wrapper around a single item, which may also be missing (null).
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	The {@link Channel} supplied to the {@link #onChange(Channel, Action)} method to register an {@link Action}
 * 	callback is expected to be a simple constant, usually one of the {@link From} constants
 * 	like for example {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW}.
 * 	You may fire a change event for a particular channel using the {@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or
 * 	in case the property is also a mutable {@link Var}, then through the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}.&lt;br&gt;
 * 	Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	If you no longer need to observe changes on this property, then you can remove the registered {@link Action}
 * 	callback using the {@link #unsubscribe(Subscriber)} method ({@link Action} is also a {@link Subscriber}).
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	Note that the name of this class is short for &quot;value&quot;. This name was deliberately chosen because
 * 	it is short, concise and yet clearly conveys the same meaning as other names used to model this
 * 	kind of pattern, like &quot;property&quot;, &quot;observable object&quot;, &quot;observable value&quot;, &quot;observable property&quot;, etc.
 *  Using {@link Var} and {@link Val} as names also allows for the distinction between
 *  mutable and immutable properties without having to resort to prefixes like &quot;mutable&quot; or &quot;immutable&quot;
 *  as part of types that are supposed to be used everywhere in your code.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	&lt;b&gt;Please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globaltcad.github.io/sprouts/&quot;&gt;living sprouts documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 * 	where you can browse a large collection of examples demonstrating how to use the API of this class.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * @see Var A mutable subclass of this class.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by this {@link Val}.
