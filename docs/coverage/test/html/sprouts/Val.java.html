/**
 *  A read only wrapper around an item which can be mapped to a weakly referenced {@link Viewable}
 *  to then be observed for changes using {@link Action}s registered through the
 *  {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)} method,
 *  where the {@link Channel} is used to distinguish between changes from
 *  different sources (usually application layers like the view model or the view).&lt;br&gt;
 *  Use {@link #view()} to access a simple no-op live view of the item of this property
 *  and register change listeners on it to react to state changes.
 *  When the {@link Viewable} is no longer referenced strongly in your code,
 *  then it will be garbage collected alongside all of its listeners.&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  The {@link Channel} supplied to the {@link Viewable#onChange(Channel, Action)} method to register an {@link Action}
 *  callback is expected to be a simple constant, usually one of the {@link From} constants
 *  like for example {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} or {@link From#VIEW}.
 *  You may fire a change event for a particular channel using the {@link #fireChange(Channel)} method or
 *  in case the property is also a mutable {@link Var}, then through the {@link Var#set(Channel, Object)}.&lt;br&gt;
 *  Note that {@link Var#set(Object)} method defaults to the {@link From#VIEW_MODEL} channel.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  If you no longer need to observe changes a {@link Viewable} created from this property,
 *  then you can remove any registered {@link Action} callback using
 *  the {@link Viewable#unsubscribe(Subscriber)} method ({@link Action} is also a {@link Subscriber}).
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Note that the name of this class is short for &quot;value&quot;.
 *  Its API is inspired by the {@link Optional} API in the
 *  sense that it is a null safe wrapper around a single item, which may also be missing (null).
 *  The name of this class was deliberately chosen because
 *  it is short, concise and yet clearly conveys the same meaning as other names used to model this
 *  kind of pattern, like &quot;property&quot;, &quot;observable object&quot;, &quot;observable value&quot;, &quot;observable property&quot;, etc.
 *  Using {@link Var} and {@link Val} as names also allows for the distinction between
 *  mutable and immutable properties without having to resort to prefixes like &quot;mutable&quot; or &quot;immutable&quot;
 *  as part of types that are supposed to be used everywhere in your code.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;Please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://globaltcad.github.io/sprouts/&quot;&gt;living sprouts documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 *  where you can browse a large collection of examples demonstrating how to use the API of this class.&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * @see Var A mutable subclass of this class.
 * @see Viewable A weakly referenced, read only live view of mutable properties
 *               to be used for registering change listeners.
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the item held by this {@link Val}.
