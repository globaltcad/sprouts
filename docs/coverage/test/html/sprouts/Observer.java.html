/**
 *  An observer is a callback that is executed when a
 *  sprouts {@link Observable} is triggered, usually in the
 *  form of an {@link Event} or property, like
 *  {@link Val}, {@link Var}, {@link Vals} or {@link Vars}.
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Note that this kind of listener is different from the
 *  {@link Action} listener in that the {@link Action} listener
 *  also receives a parameter, which is typically the cause of the event
 *  or other relevant context. &lt;br&gt;
 *  An observer on the other hand is a simple callback that is executed
 *  when something happens, without any context.

	/**
	 *  A factory method for creating a new {@link Observer} instance
	 *  with a weakly referenced owner.
     *  When the owner is garbage collected then the observer will no longer be executed,
     *  removed and eventually garbage automatically as well.&lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;b&gt;
     *      WARNING: &lt;br&gt;
     *      If you reference the owner in the observer lambda, may it be directly or indirectly,
     *      then you will end up with a memory leak, as the owner will never be garbage collected!
     *  &lt;/b&gt;
     *  &lt;br&gt;
     *  This is because the observer lambda is strongly held until the owner is collected, and
     *  the owner may only be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it.
     *  This includes the supplied observer lambda action, which may not hold a strong reference to the owner!
     *  In order to access the owner of the observer in the supplied {@link Consumer},
     *  it is passed to it as its first argument.
	 *  &lt;b&gt;Use that parameter instead of capturing an owner reference.&lt;/b&gt;
	 *
	 * @param owner The owner of the observer, which is weakly referenced
	 *              and determines the lifetime of the observer.
	 * @param observer A {@link Consumer} that takes in the owner when invoked.
	 * @return A new {@link Observer} instance with a weakly referenced owner.
	 * @param &lt;O&gt; The type of the owner.
